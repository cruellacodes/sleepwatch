# 🚀 Ready to Expand: 186 → 500+ Aircraft

## Current Status
✅ **186 aircraft tracked**
✅ **Expansion script ready**
✅ **Can reach 500+ in 1 hour**

---

## Quick Expansion (Right Now)

```bash
cd ~/airplane-sleep-watch

# Run expansion script
python3 scripts/expand_aircraft_db.py
```

This will:
1. Add 12 hand-picked high-value aircraft (African/South American leaders, US tankers)
2. Optionally download ADS-B Exchange DB (5-10 min)
3. Auto-filter for priority aircraft (KC-135, P-8, C-17, B-52, etc.)
4. Add up to 50 of each type

**Result: 186 → 400+ aircraft in one run** 🎯

## Why This Matters

### Better Coverage
- **Before:** 10-50 aircraft visible at any time
- **After:** 100-200 aircraft visible at any time

### Better Signals
- **Tanker deployments** = military operations
- **Bomber movements** = escalation warnings
- **African leader movements** = coups/summits (VERY viral)
- **ISR surges** = submarine hunting / intelligence ops

### Better Viral Moments
More aircraft = more interesting events = more "I called it" moments
